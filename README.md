This package exports a suite of types and methods useful for defining arbitrary lattice geometries, and constructing neighbor tables.
The [`LatticeUtilities.jl`](https://github.com/cohensbw/LatticeUtilities.jl) package is intended to be a lightweigh utility package
useful in the development of other, more complicated packages.
